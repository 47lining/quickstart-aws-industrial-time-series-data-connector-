## OSIsoft PI System to AWS Connector on the AWS Cloud


This Quick Start deploys the OSIsoft PI System to AWS Connector on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. The connector synchronizes your OSIsoft PI System data to AWS to enable advanced analytics on your industrial process time-series data.

You can deploy the connector from your own AWS account in less than an hour. After deployment, you can establish near real-time managed feeds for selected data, get your data to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), keep it current, and explore and analyze your data with AWS analytics services such as Amazon Elasticsearch (Amazon ES) with Kibana and Amazon Kinesis.

The Quick Start offers two deployment options:

- Deploying OSIsoft PI System to AWS Connector into a new virtual private cloud (VPC) on AWS
- Deploying OSIsoft PI System to AWS Connector into an existing VPC on AWS

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
